# Task

Add a first-class **nucleus instance mask** input to `lib/abiss` (`NUC_PATH`, dtype
`uint32`) and use it to guide agglomeration, so that supervoxel clusters carrying
different nucleus ids are never merged into one segment.

The literal user request:

> "given the context above, add a feature in abiss to make use of nucleus instance mask uint32"

## Repository and Working Copy

The code lives in the **`lib/abiss` repository** (`https://github.com/PytorchConnectomics/abiss`),
which is a standalone git repo. `lib/` is gitignored by the parent `pytorch_connectomics`
repo, so abiss changes never appear in a parent diff. All CCC git baselines and diffs for
this run therefore target abiss, not pytorch_connectomics.

**Standing constraint carried over from `.agent/features/abiss_speedup/`:** build
experiments must NOT touch `lib/abiss` in place. A previous run broke a live SLURM chain by
rebuilding `lib/abiss/build/` while jobs were executing those binaries. SLURM job 2787863
(`v3mim_verify`, from the abiss_speedup bench) was running against abiss at the start of
this run.

Accordingly, this run works on an isolated clone:

```text
.agent/features/abiss_nucleus/work/abiss   (git clone of lib/abiss, detached at 3c4f562, clean, no build/)
```

The live `lib/abiss` checkout is read-only for this run. All edits, builds, and diffs happen
inside `work/abiss`.

## Background: what abiss already has

ABISS already carries a *semantic class* guidance path end-to-end, at three injection
points. The nucleus feature should parallel it, not overload it.

**P1 - pre-watershed affinity cut.** `scripts/cut_chunk_ws.py:31` calls
`augment_affinity.py:147` `mask_affinity_with_semantic_labels`, which zeroes the affinity
edge wherever the two voxels carry *different nonzero* sem labels. This test is already
identity-based (`sem_offset != sem_aligned`), not class-based. Gated by `SEMANTIC_WS`.

**P2 - per-supervoxel payload.** `src/seg/SemExtractor.hpp` accumulates a fixed 3-bin
histogram per supervoxel through a 6->3 class LUT (`sem_map`, line 61). Serialized as
`ongoing_semantic_labels.data` and carried through the chunk hierarchy by
`match_chunks.py:126`, `reduce_chunk.py:111`, `merge_chunks_me.py:59`,
`merge_chunks_overlap.py:65`.

**P3 - agglomeration veto.** `src/agg/mean_aggl.cpp:625` `sem_can_merge` requires both
clusters to have a dominant label (>= `dominant_signal_ratio` 0.6 of counts, >=
`total_signal_threshold` 100k voxels); if the dominants differ the edge is refused and
logged to `sem_cuts.data`. Applied at line 699 **only when the edge weight is <= 0.5**
(`sem_params.aff_threshold`, line 130). Cluster payload is combined by summation at lines
754-758.

**P4 - size veto.** `src/agg/mean_aggl.cpp:709-718` refuses a merge when both sides are
large. This heuristic exists precisely because the code cannot otherwise tell a real cell
body from a runaway merge.

## Why a separate `NUC_PATH` rather than reusing `SEM_PATH`

Decided with the user before this run started:

1. `semantic_t = uint8_t` (`src/seg/Types.h:25`) caps instances at 255. Widening it in
   place would change the on-disk meaning of every existing sem file.
2. `SemExtractor` is lossy by design (6 classes -> 3 bins); an instance id must survive
   verbatim.
3. The predicates genuinely differ. Sem is "different classes should not merge, and only
   for weak edges." Nucleus is "different cells must never merge, at any affinity." One
   shared `aff_threshold` forces one of them to be wrong.
4. They compose: class veto for axon/dendrite *and* instance veto for cell bodies should be
   usable simultaneously. Overloading one channel makes them mutually exclusive.
5. The sem path is already inconsistent: `match_chunks.py:122` reads `nlabels = 5` while
   `reduce_chunk.py:108` and `sem_array_t` are both 3. That OVERLAP=2 branch is broken or
   dead; building on it inherits the defect. Do not copy `process_sems` blindly.

## Design intent

Carry a fixed-width per-cluster nucleus record so every plumbing script stays a one-line
mirror of the existing sem lines:

```text
(seg_t sid, nuc_t id, size_t count, size_t total)
```

`count` = voxels of the dominant id, `total` = all nucleus-tagged voxels in the cluster.
This is exact *given* the veto, because a cluster can never legitimately end up holding two
different ids: any such merge is refused before it happens. Do not serialize a
variable-length id->count map; that is only needed for a soft veto and it breaks the
fixed-record assumption in five scripts.

The veto should be **ungated by affinity**, unlike the sem veto: an instance nucleus mask is
far more trustworthy than a semantic net prediction, and a soma-soma fusion is far more
expensive than a stray cut. Keep a minimum tagged-voxel threshold so a handful of
misassigned voxels cannot hard-split a real cell.

Optional companion, if the plan judges it in scope: a `NUC_WS` flag mirroring `SEMANTIC_WS`
at `cut_chunk_ws.py:31`, reusing the `mask_affinity_with_semantic_labels` mechanism. It
makes "one supervoxel carries at most one nucleus id" true by construction, which is what
makes the fixed-width record exact.

`traverseSegments` (`src/seg/Utils.hpp:112`) is fully variadic, so adding an extractor is
mechanical. Note that `src/seg/atomic_chunk_ME.cpp:78-104` currently duplicates the whole
call for the sem/no-sem case; a second optional payload turns that into four branches, so
prefer making the new extractor a no-op when its input file is absent, or hoist the pack.

Also note: agglomeration parameters are compile-time constants
(`src/agg/mean_aggl.cpp:121-153`); `main` only parses `argv[1]` as the agglomeration
threshold (lines 1145-1149). Any new tunable is a recompile unless the plan adds env or
argument parsing.

## Scope

**In scope:** the `lib/abiss` repository only - C++ (`src/seg/`, `src/agg/`) and the
Python/bash chunk drivers under `scripts/`.

**Out of scope:** the pytorch_connectomics wrapper. `connectomics/decoding/decoders/abiss.py`
has no `SEM_PATH` plumbing today and gains no `NUC_PATH` plumbing in this run. Also out of
scope: generating the nucleus instance mask itself, and the perinuclear-shell tagging
preprocessing step described below.

## Known caveat the implementation cannot fix

The nuclear envelope is a membrane; affinity networks put a boundary on it, so the nucleus
interior often becomes its own cluster that never joins the soma. An id parked there
constrains nothing. Correct usage tags *perinuclear cytoplasm* (dilate each instance, take
shell = dilated minus nucleus, assign id k to supervoxels dominated by shell k). That is a
preprocessing step on the nucleus volume, outside abiss and outside this run's scope, but
the feature should be documented so a user does not assume raw nucleus interiors work.

## Constraints

* Do not modify the live `lib/abiss` checkout; work only in `work/abiss`.
* Do not create git commits during this CCC run.
* Do not add runtime or build dependencies without explicit user approval
  (`AGENTS.md` Environment section, parent repo).
* Existing behavior with no `NUC_PATH` configured must be bit-identical to the current
  pipeline. This repo reproduces a Seuron provenance record; a silent change to default
  segmentation output is a hard failure.
* Keep the diff scoped. Do not opportunistically fix the `nlabels = 5` sem bug in the same
  change unless the plan argues it is required; if it is left alone, say so.

## Success criteria

1. `NUC_PATH` (plus any needed `NUC_MIP`) is accepted end-to-end: config JSON -> `set_env.py`
   -> `cut_chunk_agg.py` writes `nuc.raw` -> C++ extractor -> agglomeration veto ->
   per-chunk serialization -> chunk hierarchy reduce/merge/match.
2. Two clusters carrying different nucleus ids are never merged, at any affinity, subject to
   the minimum tagged-voxel threshold.
3. Refused nucleus edges are logged to their own cut file, mirroring `sem_cuts.data`.
4. Nucleus ids are `uint32`, not `uint8`.
5. With `NUC_PATH` absent, output is unchanged from baseline.
6. The build succeeds inside `work/abiss` and the verification evidence is real command
   output, not asserted.
