"""Slice-based branch merge for waterz segmentation postprocessing.

Resolves false splits by analyzing segment continuity across z-slices.  Merge
candidates are only considered at z-boundaries where a segment *ends* or
*begins* (its bbox z-extremes); interior 2D overlap between neighbours is
coincidence, and merging on it chains adjacent neurons through the union-find
(ARE 0.05 → 0.92 on SNEMI).

The algorithm runs in three stages, in this order:

1. **Cross-section completion** (:func:`complete_sections`) — absorb every
   1-slice/small fragment into the segment it most touches, so each
   cross-section is whole before any IoU is computed.

2. **Mutual IoU merge** (:func:`merge_sections`) — per z-seam, pick the
   best-IoU partner, require it to be mutual and to beat the runner-up by
   ``margin``, with the mean seam z-affinity used only as a background floor.

3. **Weak-gap bridge** (:func:`bridge_weak_gaps`) — the same operator reaching
   across *g* weak-affinity slices, scoring the projected cross-section mask.

:func:`completion_radius_link` (stage 4) is opt-in via ``prefer_length``: it
links open ends by radius and is oracle-merge-negative.

===============================================================================
CUE LADDER — what to trust when deciding "are these two pieces one neuron?"
===============================================================================
Ordered MOST → LEAST robust. Measured on MIT-LiCONN DL288B (NERL base +
oracle-merge om, merge_threshold=10); "om-safe" = the false-merge-free ceiling
did not drop. Use a lower cue only to *veto*, never to *select*.

 1. SHAPE CONTINUITY — real (unshifted) cross-section IoU.          [primary]
    fn: `merge_sections`
    The one signal that actually says "same tube". Selecting by IoU instead of
    affinity moved base 0.7495 → 0.7840. PRECONDITION: the cross-sections must
    be WHOLE (see cue 2) or the IoU is computed on half a tube and lies.

 2. CROSS-SECTION COMPLETENESS — absorb 1-slice/small fragments first.
    fn: `complete_sections`  (lateral neighbour, else best-IoU z-neighbour)
    A fragment holding half a cross-section makes a true merge look like a
    non-match (real case: IoU 0.79 pair invisible because one side was a
    645-vox fragment). base +0.009, om +0.001 — the cheapest win here.

 3. MUTUAL AGREEMENT — both endpoints pick each other.              [safety]
    fn: `merge_sections` (the `up`/`down` cross-check before union-find)
    Mutual-best is merge-SAFE; one-sided dominance is not (it chains adjacent
    neurons — the ARE 0.05 → 0.92 collapse noted above). Never merge on a
    one-sided preference alone.

 4. UNAMBIGUITY — the best partner must beat the runner-up by `margin`.
    fn: `merge_sections(margin=...)`, `bridge_weak_gaps(margin=...)`
    "No other close/confusing match." Rejecting 5 ambiguous pairs bought
    om +0.002 at zero base cost. If two candidates are close, LEAVE IT SPLIT —
    a false merge costs far more than a residual split.
    CAVEAT: this only protects you if the true partner is INSIDE the search
    window; a truncated search makes a wrong match look certain.

 5. ENDPOINT RESTRICTION — only where a segment begins/ends.        [veto]
    fn: `merge_sections` (candidates are read at each segment's bbox z0/z1)
    Interior 2D overlap between neighbours is coincidence, not continuity.

 6. Z-AFFINITY — a background FLOOR, not a selector.                [veto]
    fn: `merge_sections` (mean seam affinity vs `aff_lo`)
    Strong-affinity seams are already merged upstream, so what remains is
    mostly LOW-affinity; ranking by affinity picks the wrong partner at a
    2-branch junction. Use it to exclude background (> ~0.4), nothing more.

 7. CALIBER / AREA RATIO — weak.                                    [veto only]
    Matches thickness, not shape; happily fuses a same-size neighbour.

 8. TRAJECTORY EXTRAPOLATION — least robust; do not select on it.
    Velocity from a few slices is noisy, a false merge is *also* collinear,
    and it cannot follow a tube that drifts >1 radius across a gap. Every
    variant tried (collinear veto, low-IoU collinear rescue) was net-negative.

 9. ENDPOINT PROXIMITY — not usable on its own.
    Linking nearest open ends lost om in every configuration tested; the
    correct links were not separable from the false ones by distance.

RULE OF THUMB: cues 1–2 decide, 3–4 make it safe, 5–7 veto, 8–9 are for
diagnostics/ranking only. To go beyond this ladder you need a signal shape does
not carry (membrane/orthogonal-plane evidence, or a learned scorer).

    Every default below is the validated value; see the CUE LADDER above for the
    evidence behind each. The two that move the result most:

    - ``merge_iou`` -- cross-section IoU required to consider a partner at a
      z-seam. Selecting by IoU rather than affinity moved base 0.7495 -> 0.7840;
      the seam affinity is only a background floor (``aff_lo``), never a ranker.
    - ``margin`` -- the best partner must beat the runner-up by this IoU gap or
      the pair is left split. Rejecting 5 ambiguous merges bought +0.002 oracle
      ceiling at zero base cost. Raise it to be more conservative; a false merge
      costs far more than a residual split.

    The ``weak_*`` group is the same operator reaching across ``weak_max_gap``
    slices of weak (``> weak_lo``) foreground instead of one seam.

    ``prefer_length=True`` additionally runs the completion-driven radius link.
    That optional research stage is known to reduce the oracle-merge ceiling and
    is deliberately disabled by default.
