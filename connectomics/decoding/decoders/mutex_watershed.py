"""Mutex Watershed decoder.

Converts affinity predictions with **both** short-range (attractive) and
long-range (repulsive) offsets into an instance segmentation without any
seeds, thresholds, or agglomeration step (Wolf et al., "The Mutex Watershed",
ECCV 2018 / TPAMI 2020).

Wraps ``affogato.segmentation.compute_mws_segmentation`` — the reference
implementation from the paper's authors — the same way :mod:`waterz.py` wraps
waterz.

Requires ``affogato`` (C++/xtensor, conda-forge only — the PyPI ``affogato``
is an unrelated project): ``conda install -c conda-forge affogato``

    r"""Convert affinity predictions to instance segmentation via Mutex Watershed.

    The Mutex Watershed sorts *all* affinity edges (attractive + repulsive) by
    weight and greedily processes them with a union-find that also tracks
    mutual-exclusion (mutex) constraints: an attractive edge merges two regions
    unless a mutex forbids it; a repulsive edge adds a mutex. No threshold or
    seed is needed — segment boundaries emerge where repulsion dominates.

    Args:
        predictions: Affinity predictions of shape :math:`(C, Z, Y, X)`, float
            in ``[0, 1]``, where ``C == len(offsets)``. The first
            ``num_attractive`` channels are the short-range attractive edges;
            the remainder are long-range repulsive (mutex) edges.
        offsets: Edge offsets, one per channel, as ``"z-y-x"`` strings or
            length-3 sequences (negative components allowed as sequences, e.g.
            ``[-1, 0, 0]``). Defaults to the standard 6-channel banis layout
            (3 nearest-neighbor + 3 long-range at distance 10) when ``C == 6``.
        num_attractive: Number of leading channels treated as attractive
            (short-range) edges. Default: 3.
        strides: Optional per-axis subsampling of the *repulsive* edges (e.g.
            ``[1, 4, 4]``) — the standard speed/quality knob for MWS on dense
            long-range affinities. ``None`` uses every edge. Default: None.
        randomize_strides: Randomly sample strided repulsive edges rather than
            taking them on a fixed grid, reducing striding artifacts. Only used
            when ``strides`` is set. Default: True.
        invert_repulsive: PyTC networks predict affinity as ``P(same segment)``
            (high = merge) for *every* channel, including long-range ones. MWS
            needs repulsive edges where high = *split*, so the repulsive
            channels are inverted (``1 - aff``). Set False only if your model
            already predicts long-range repulsion/boundary directly.
            Default: True.
        invert_attractive: Invert the attractive channels too (for models that
            predict boundary probability instead of affinity). Default: False.
        mask: Optional boolean foreground mask of shape :math:`(Z, Y, X)`.
            Voxels outside the mask are left as background (label 0).
        min_instance_size: Remove instances smaller than this many voxels
            (set to background). 0 disables. Default: 0.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments (silently ignored for YAML
            config compatibility).

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Instance segmentation of shape :math:`(Z, Y, X)`.

    Raises:
        ImportError: If ``affogato`` is not installed.
        ValueError: If predictions have wrong shape or channel/offset mismatch.

    Examples:
        >>> # 6-channel banis affinities (3 attractive + 3 long-range)
        >>> seg = decode_mutex_watershed(affs)

        >>> # Anisotropic subsampling of repulsive edges for speed
        >>> seg = decode_mutex_watershed(affs, strides=[1, 4, 4])
