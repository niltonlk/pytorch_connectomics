    r"""Convert binary foreground probability maps, instance contours and signed distance
    transform to instance masks via watershed or connected components.

    This unified function supports both watershed and connected components approaches for
    instance segmentation from multi-channel predictions (binary, contour, distance).

    Note:
        When using watershed mode, this function uses `mahotas.cwatershed` which converts
        the input into ``np.float64`` data type for processing. Please ensure enough memory
        is allocated when handling large arrays.

    Args:
        predictions (numpy.ndarray): Multi-channel prediction map of shape :math:`(C, Z, Y, X)`.
            Typically contains binary foreground, instance contours, and signed distance transform.
        mode (str): Decoding algorithm to use. Options:
            - 'watershed': Use watershed segmentation with distance transform (more accurate)
            - 'cc': Use connected components (faster, simpler)
            Default: 'watershed'
        binary_channels (list of int, optional): Channel indices for binary foreground mask.
            If multiple channels provided, they are reduced by ``binary_channel_reduction``.
            Default: [0]
        contour_channels (list of int, optional): Channel indices for instance contours.
            If multiple channels provided, they are averaged. Set to None to disable contour
            constraints (for BANIS-style binary+distance only). Default: [1]
        distance_channels (list of int, optional): Channel indices for signed distance transform.
            If multiple channels provided, they are averaged. Default: [2]
        binary_channel_reduction (str): Reduction for multiple binary channels. Options are
            "mean", "min", and "max". Default: "mean".
        binary_threshold (tuple): Tuple of two floats (seed_threshold,
            foreground_threshold) for binary mask. The first value is used for
            seed generation, the second for foreground mask. Default: (0.9, 0.85)
        contour_threshold (tuple or None): Tuple of two floats (seed_threshold,
            foreground_threshold) for instance contours. The first value is used
            for seed generation, the second for foreground mask. Set to None to
            disable contour constraints. Default: (0.8, 1.1)
        distance_threshold (tuple): Tuple of two floats (seed_threshold,
            foreground_threshold) for signed distance. The first value is used
            for seed generation, the second for foreground mask. Default: (0.5, 0)
        precomputed_seed (numpy.ndarray, optional): Precomputed seed map to use instead of
            computing seeds from thresholds. Default: None
        min_seed_size (int): Minimum size of seed objects in pixels. Seeds smaller than this
            are removed before watershed. Only used in watershed mode. Default: 32
        min_instance_size (int): Minimum size of final instance objects in voxels. Instances
            smaller than this are removed after watershed/cc segmentation. Set to 0 to disable.
            Default: 0
        return_seed (bool): Whether to return the seed map along with the segmentation.
            If True, returns (segmentation, seed). Only applicable in watershed mode. Default: False
        **kwargs: Additional parameters for compatibility with YAML configs.
            Unused parameters are silently ignored.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray or tuple: Instance segmentation mask of shape :math:`(Z, Y, X)`.
            If return_seed=True (watershed mode only), returns tuple (segmentation, seed).

    Convert signed distance transform (SDT) predictions to instance segmentation
    via watershed with recomputed Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT).

    This function implements the SDT-only approach where:
    1. Predicted SDT determines foreground mask (SDT > 0)
    2. Precise EDT is recomputed on the foreground mask
    3. Watershed uses the recomputed EDT (not predicted SDT)

    Key Difference from decode_instance_binary_contour_distance:
    - This function RECOMPUTES precise geometric EDT from foreground mask
    - decode_instance_binary_contour_distance uses predicted distance directly
    - Generally more accurate but slower due to EDT computation

    The recomputed EDT provides ground-truth Euclidean distances within the
    foreground mask, which can be more reliable for watershed flooding compared
    to using the network's predicted distance values directly.

    Args:
        predictions (np.ndarray): Predictions of shape :math:`(C, Z, Y, X)`.
            Typically contains SDT predictions in one or more channels.
        distance_channels (list of int, optional): Channel indices for SDT.
            If multiple channels provided, they are averaged. Default: [0]
        distance_threshold (tuple): Tuple of two floats (seed_threshold, foreground_threshold).
            - threshold[0]: SDT threshold for seeds (instance centers). Default: 0.5
            - threshold[1]: SDT threshold for foreground (instance regions). Default: 0
        min_seed_size (int): Minimum seed size in pixels. Seeds smaller than this
            are removed before watershed. Default: 50
        min_instance_size (int): Minimum size of final instance objects in voxels.
            Instances smaller than this are removed after watershed. Set to 0 to disable.
            Default: 0
        use_fast_edt (bool): Use fast edt library if available for acceleration.
            Falls back to scipy if library not installed. Default: True
        edt_parallel (int): Number of parallel threads for fast edt library.
            Only used if use_fast_edt=True and edt library is available. Default: 4
        edt_anisotropy (tuple or None): Anisotropy values for EDT computation
            (e.g., (3.75, 1.0, 1.0) for anisotropic EM data with 30nm z vs 8nm xy).
            If None, assumes isotropic (all 1.0). Default: None
        edt_downsample_factor (int): Downsample factor for EDT computation to save
            memory/time. If > 1, foreground mask is downsampled, EDT computed, then
            upsampled and scaled. Default: 1 (no downsampling)
        return_seed (bool): Whether to return the seed map along with the segmentation.
            If True, returns (segmentation, seed). Default: False
        **kwargs: Additional parameters for compatibility with YAML configs.
            Unused parameters (binary_channels, contour_channels, binary_threshold,
            contour_threshold, mode, etc.) are silently ignored.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray or tuple: Instance segmentation mask of shape :math:`(Z, Y, X)`.
            If return_seed=True, returns tuple (segmentation, seed).

    Examples:
        >>> # Basic usage with default parameters

    first 3 of ``affinity_channels`` if supplied) to build a connectivity graph,
    then performs flood-fill to identify connected components. Each component
    receives a unique instance ID.

    Args:
        affinities (numpy.ndarray): Affinity predictions of shape :math:`(C, Z, Y, X)` where:

            - C >= 3 (or len(affinity_channels) >= 3)
            - Channel 0: x-direction (left-right) connections
            - Channel 1: y-direction (top-bottom) connections
            - Channel 2: z-direction (front-back) connections
            - Channels 3+: long-range affinities (ignored unless selected via affinity_channels)
        affinity_channels (list[int], optional): Explicit channel indices to use as the
            three short-range affinities. When provided, ``affinities[affinity_channels]``
            is used instead of ``affinities[:3]``. Useful when saving multi-scale
            predictions (e.g. 9-channel r3/r1@ero2/r10) and decoding on a specific
            3-channel subset. Auto-resolved by the pipeline from YAML-selector strings.
            Default: ``None`` (use the first 3 channels).

        threshold (float): Threshold for binarizing affinities. Affinities > threshold
            indicate connected voxels. Default: 0.5
        backend (str): Connected-components backend. Options:
            - ``"cc3d"`` (default): Fast, predictable startup; ignores directed affinity graph
              and runs connected components on foreground voxels.
            - ``"numba"``: Multi-threaded affinity-graph CC via parallel min-label sweeps
              (first call may incur JIT compile overhead). Bit-exact with ``"numba_serial"``.
            - ``"numba_serial"``: Original single-threaded DFS flood-fill kept as a reference
              fallback.
            - ``"cupy"``: Single-GPU min-label sweeps via cupy. Same partition as
              ``"numba_serial"``; bit-exact for ``edge_offset=0``. Requires cupy and
              enough GPU memory for ~17×volume bytes.
            - ``"auto"``: Use Numba if available, else cc3d.
        edge_offset (int): Index of the edge ``v ↔ v+1`` along each axis, relative
            to source voxel ``v``. ``0`` = source-index (BANIS's ``comp_affinities``
            stores the edge at ``v``). ``1`` = destination-index
            (``affinity_mode=deepem``, zwatershed, abiss store the edge at ``v+1``).
            Only used when ``backend="numba"``. Default: ``0``.
        orphan_fill (bool): If True, recover voxels with positive but sub-threshold
            short-range affinities by running a second CC on the leftover foreground
            mask and assigning new labels. Default: ``False`` (BANIS reference
            behavior; avoids allocating the full ``(short > 0).any(axis=0)`` bool
            volume).

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: Instance segmentation mask of shape :math:`(Z, Y, X)` with
            dtype uint32. Each connected component has a unique ID >= 1, background is 0.

    Examples:
        >>> # Basic usage with affinity predictions
        >>> affinities = model(image)  # Shape: (6, 128, 128, 128)
        >>> segmentation = decode_affinity_cc(affinities, threshold=0.5)
        >>> print(segmentation.shape)  # (128, 128, 128)
        >>> print(segmentation.max())  # Number of instances

    Note:
        - ``backend="numba"`` may incur substantial one-time JIT compilation latency on first use.
        - **6-connectivity**: Uses face neighbors only (not edges/corners)
        - **Short-range only**: Only first 3 channels used, long-range ignored
        - **Memory efficient**: Processes in-place when possible
