"""Shape smoothing for tube-like instance segmentations.

An affinity watershed leaves two shape defects that are cheap to fix from
geometry alone, without going back to the affinity:

1. **Thin protrusions and hairline bridges.** A one-voxel neck can fuse two
   otherwise clean tubes. A multi-label morphological opening removes the neck,
   and a connected-components relabel then separates what the neck was holding
   together.

2. **Cross-section jumps.** Where a tube absorbs a neighbour, its per-slice
   area steps up and stays up for a run of slices. The step is an outlier
   against the label's own local median area, which makes it detectable without
   ground truth.

The stage runs, in order: ``fastmorph`` label opening -> ``cc3d`` relabel ->
cross-z outlier split.

===============================================================================
THE CROSS-Z SPLIT
===============================================================================
This reuses the boundary-placement idiom validated in ``branch.split``: propagate
the ACTUAL cross-section mask rather than a disk seed, and let a distance
watershed place the boundary.

At the first slice of an area-outlier run, the previous slice is what the tube
looked like before the jump. Eroding it gives a marker for the continuation; the
part of the current cross-section that this marker does not explain is the extra
region, and it seeds the second marker. A distance-transform watershed over the
current cross-section then partitions it into "the tube" and "what joined it".
The kept part becomes the reference for the next slice, so the carve tracks the
tube through the whole run instead of drifting.

Cue-wise this is the one-sided case (see ``branch.split``: TWO-SIDED ANCHORING
is preferred, ONE-SIDED CARVE is riskier), so the run is bounded by the outlier
detection and aborts as soon as the extra region stops being substantial.
Splitting cannot lower the false-merge-free ceiling, but a badly placed boundary
still leaks voxels, hence the conservative gates.

        anisotropy: voxel size passed to the spherical opening.
        connectivity: ``cc3d`` connectivity for the relabel that follows the

            long-enough tube. The span gate is ``max(split_min_span,

            as horizontal stripes across an otherwise clean tube.
        keep_ratio: each carved slice must keep at least this fraction of the
