"""Propose joins across free skeleton ends under a semantic-type constraint.

A segment that stops inside the crop has an unexplained end. This module pairs
such an end with somewhere on another segment and scores the pairing; it does not
apply anything, read any file, or claim a join is correct.

Two design choices carry over from measured failures of earlier tip linkers and
are not free parameters:

*One tip, not two.* Requiring both sides to present a facing terminal ("tip-tip")
throws away the common case where a broken process should rejoin the *side* of
its continuation, and shape-only facing models did not reach usable precision.
A candidate therefore needs one free end on the left and merely a reachable
skeleton point on the right; :class:`LinkConfig` can still demand a mutual pair.

*Geometry proposes, affinity decides.* Gap length, caliber agreement and tangent
alignment rank candidates well but do not separate true continuations from
neighbours running alongside. The affinity probe is injected by the caller, so
this module stays I/O-free, but a candidate with no affinity evidence is reported
with ``affinity=None`` and is never accepted when a floor is configured.

Joins are asymmetric in cost: one wrong join can fuse two processes for their
whole length, while a missed join costs only that one gap. The defaults are
therefore conservative, and ``accepted`` means "passed every configured gate",
never "verified". Without ground truth the precision of this proposer on any
given volume is unknown.

    ``max_gap_um`` is the straight distance between the free end and the point it
    would attach to. ``min_caliber_ratio`` compares the two local *shaft* radii,
    thinner over thicker -- see :attr:`LinkSite.caliber_um` for why the terminal
    vertex's own radius must not be used here. ``max_tangent_deg`` bounds the angle between the free end's
    outward direction and the direction to its partner: a continuation leaves
    roughly the way it was heading, a neighbour running alongside does not.

    ``min_affinity`` is compared against whatever scale the caller's probe
    returns; passing the same threshold the decoder agglomerated at makes the
    result readable as "this gap would have merged had the boundary not been
    there".

    ``require_mutual`` keeps only pairs that are each other's best partner. It is
    a large precision gain for tip-to-tip pairs and a total loss for the one-tip
    route, which has no reverse candidate to be mutual with; see
    :func:`select_links`.

    ``apply_semantic_gate`` can switch the axon/dendrite veto off. Do that when
    the volume's caliber distribution does not actually support the class
    distinction: a veto driven by an unsupported label removes good candidates
    and adds no safety. The caliber *ratio* still applies either way, and is the
