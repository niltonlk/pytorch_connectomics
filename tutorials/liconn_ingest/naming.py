"""Filename grammar and spacing arithmetic for LICONN microscope drops.

Pure functions, no I/O -- this is the part that is easy to get silently wrong,
so it is separated out and unit tested (`test_naming.py`).

THE TRAP THIS FILE EXISTS FOR. A moe ND2 filename looks like

    ExPID71_120ms-30ms_600nm_40XW02.nd2

and Moe states the plane was illuminated **30 ms first, then 120 ms**. Filename
order is therefore NOT acquisition order. Nothing here may return an acquisition
order: `parse_stem` reports the exposures as an unordered set and the caller must
resolve order from ND2 per-frame metadata. See spec.md I7 in
research/projects/msi_liconn_deploy/.

SPACING. Physical (biological) spacing = optics spacing / linear expansion fold.
The optics spacing is recorded in the ND2; the fold is NOT -- it comes from the
filename or the drop folder. That asymmetry is why `spacing_source` is carried
through to provenance rather than assumed.
