# Builds the LICONN moe cloud image on a disposable builder VM and publishes it
# to the run prefix as a GCS archive. Runs as root, unattended.
#
# WHY A BUILDER VM AND NOT CLOUD BUILD OR A LOCAL DOCKER. This is the pattern
# that already worked for `tutorials/dispim_gcloud` from this same workstation
# (see gs://donglai/dispim/.../cloud-runs/*/build.sh):
#   * the workstation is an arm64 Mac with no Docker installed, so a local build
#     would be an emulated cross-build of PyTorch plus a C++ watershed;
#   * Cloud Build can build in this project but cannot publish. It now runs as
#     the Compute Engine default service account, which holds no Artifact
#     Registry binding, and only the project OWNER can grant one. Measured:
#     the build step succeeds and the push fails.
# Shipping the image as a GCS object needs only bucket permissions, which the
# operating account already has. It also removes Artifact Registry from the
# critical path entirely.
#
# Metadata in: source-archive, image-tag, run-prefix, base-image-archive (opt).
