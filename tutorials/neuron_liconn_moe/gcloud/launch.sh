#
# THE IMAGE IS A GCS OBJECT, NOT A REGISTRY IMAGE. This follows the pattern that
# already worked for tutorials/dispim_gcloud from this same Mac. Three reasons,
# in order of weight:
#   1. Cloud Build can build in this project but cannot PUBLISH. It runs as the
#      Compute Engine default service account, which holds no Artifact Registry
#      binding, and only the project owner can grant one. Measured, not assumed:
#      the build step succeeds and the push fails with 0 images in the repo.
#      Specifying the account that *does* hold roles/cloudbuild.builds.builder is
#      refused -- Cloud Build requires a user-managed service account.
#   2. This workstation is an arm64 Mac with no Docker, so a local build would be
#      an emulated cross-build of PyTorch plus a C++ watershed.
#   3. A GCS archive needs only bucket permissions, which the operating account
#      already has, so nothing in this path waits on an owner.
#
# WHY ONE GPU VM AND NOT THE GPU-THEN-CPU SPLIT. Releasing the GPU before the
# decode is ~28% of a large bill. This volume is 213 Mvoxel after the resample
# onto the model's [24,18,18] nm grid -- 9.9% of ABISS's uint32 watershed cap,
# ~15 GB peak RSS -- so the decode is minutes, and moving 1.3 GB of affinity
# between machines costs more than the idle GPU. Revisit for a batch, or for any
# volume decoded at native resolution.

    # SHIP THE CURRENT TUTORIAL DIRECTORY WITH THE RUN. The image carries a
    # build-time snapshot of the repo, so a volume added to volumes.py after the
    # image was built does not exist as far as the container is concerned --
    # which is precisely how a run died on `KeyError: ExPID71_...` in 2026-09-22
    # after paying for the image load, a 3.8 GB stage and the checkpoint.
    # Rebuilding the image for every recipe-table edit is the wrong answer: it
    # is ~8 minutes and trivially forgotten. vm_startup.sh bind-mounts this over
    # /workspace/tutorials/neuron_liconn_moe instead, so the recipe table, the
    # prep, the sweep and the uploader are always the working-tree versions
    # while the framework stays exactly as built and tested.
