# -> ABISS threshold sweep -> precomputed layer + meshes.
#
# Nothing here is cloud-specific except the paths. Every step is the same script
# the BC SLURM batch runs; `volumes.py` reads the LICONN_MOE_* variables set
# below, so there is no second copy of the recipe table, the prep, the sweep or
# the uploader to drift out of sync. See gcloud/README.md.
#
# The container never touches GCS. `launch.sh` stages the source group in and
# copies the artifacts out; credentials stay on the host.

# STAGES selects which half of the pipeline this container runs, so GPU work and
# the memory-hungry decode can sit on different machines.
#
# Why that is not a micro-optimisation: the decode peaks at ~71 GB per Gvoxel,
# and the most RAM obtainable with ONE L4 is 128 GiB (g2-standard-32), because
# L4s attach only to G2 shapes. A 2 Gvoxel volume therefore needs
# g2-standard-48 -- four L4s bought to rent RAM -- and on 2026-09-22 spot
# g2-standard-48 was ZONE_RESOURCE_POOL_EXHAUSTED in all three us-east1 zones
# while g2-standard-16 spot was plentiful. Splitting buys one cheap GPU box and
# one cheap high-memory CPU box instead, and is step one of the 100 um
# architecture (card MSIDEPLOY-SCALE-001) rather than a workaround.
