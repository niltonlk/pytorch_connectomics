# baked in. The log is streamed to the run prefix throughout rather than at
# exit, because a VM that dies takes its serial console with it.

# The VM's service account is the only identity here -- there is no interactive
# `gcloud auth login` on an unattended VM. launch.sh refuses to start until that
# account can actually read the source and write the destination.

# The image arrives as a GCS archive rather than from a registry: see build.sh
# for why (Cloud Build cannot publish in this project without the owner). This
# is the same mechanism the proven diSPIM cloud runs used.

# successfully in their own logs and were still RUNNING. The proven diSPIM
# workflow does not self-delete for exactly this reason; its launcher docstring
# says so outright, and the operator deletes from the workstation.
#
# THE GUARANTEE IS `--max-run-duration` WITH TERMINATION ACTION DELETE, which
# the Compute Engine control plane enforces and which needs no permission from
# the VM at all. `launch.sh --cleanup` is the prompt path; the backstop is the
# floor. A failure here must be loud, not silent.
