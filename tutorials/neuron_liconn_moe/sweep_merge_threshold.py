"""Pick the ABISS merge threshold for a moe volume, GT-free.

WHAT TRANSFERS IS THE PERCENTILE, NOT THE VALUE. The merge threshold is compared
against affinities, and the affinity distribution is not constant across this
batch: its median drifts down with expansion factor (0.53 on the in-domain IST
val, 0.47-0.49 at 18x/22x, 0.42 at 32x), because image contrast falls as more of
the field resolves into boundary. A fixed absolute threshold therefore means a
different operating point on every volume. Two demonstrations, both measured:

  * IST's swept 0.47 applied to the first moe volume produced a largest segment
    of 975 um^3 -- 17.35% of the whole 5624 um^3 field -- with a second at 6.58%
    and the third down at 0.63%. Two runaway merge chains, not a size
    distribution.
  * moe's 0.60, in turn, does not transfer to the rest of the batch. On the 28x
    and 32x volumes, agglomeration STOPS ENTIRELY at 0.68-0.69: every threshold
    at or above that returns the raw watershed unchanged (identical label count
    and coverage), because no region-graph edge is that strong. 0.60 is below
    that on some volumes and near it on others.

So the anchor is carried as a percentile of each volume's *own* affinity.
`--percentile` defaults to **62.89**, which is what the published operating point
(0.60 on `ExPID96_2ndgel_S1_40XW001_18x`) corresponds to on that volume. This is
the same reasoning that already makes `ws_high`/`ws_low` percentiles rather than
absolutes -- the merge threshold was simply left behind.

WHY NOT THE ORIGINAL "KNEE" RULE. The first run picked 0.60 by hand as the lowest
threshold whose largest segment stayed under 2% of the volume. That rule does not
survive the batch, for two independent reasons:

  * Share is not comparable across fields. These volumes run 1035-5624 um^3, so a
    fixed 2% cap is three times stricter on a 32x field than on the 18x one it
    was calibrated on.
  * Size alone cannot tell a merge chain from a soma. A 12 um box can be
    dominated by a single cell body. Volumes that have one show a "runaway"
    segment at every threshold below saturation, and the rule then selects the
    saturation point itself -- i.e. the un-agglomerated watershed, coverage 0.29
    against 0.71 for the published volume.

The sweep table and `inspect_top_segments.py` (which separates chains from somata
by SHAPE -- a chain threads the field through thin bridges, so its bounding box
is near the full volume at a few percent fill) are kept as the evidence a human
reads before accepting the pick. `plateau` in the table marks thresholds where
agglomeration is doing nothing.

`--ws-merge-thresholds` runs the watershed and region graph ONCE and agglomerates
per threshold, so the whole grid costs barely more than a single decode.
