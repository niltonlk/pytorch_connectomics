"""The eight ExPID96 "moe" volumes and how each is put on the training grid.

Single source of truth for the batch: `prepare_volume.py` invocations,
per-volume config generation, the ABISS sweep, and the neuroglancer upload all
read this. Run it directly to print the table.

THE ONE DECISION ENCODED HERE. The banis+ checkpoint was trained at
[24, 18, 18] nm ZYX (biological nm -- moe spacings already have the expansion
factor divided out, so matching nm matches neurite caliber in voxels). The eight
volumes sit at four expansions and none is a native match:

    18x  [22.22, 9.03, 9.03]   ->  factor to [24,18,18] = [1.08, 1.99, 1.99]
    22x  [18.18, 7.39, 7.39]   ->                         [1.32, 2.44, 2.44]
    28x  [14.29, 5.80, 5.80]   ->                         [1.68, 3.10, 3.10]
    32x  [12.50, 5.08, 5.08]   ->                         [1.92, 3.54, 3.54]

The 18x pair takes `factor` -- an exact (1,2,2) block average landing on
[22.22, 18.06, 18.06], within 0.3% of the training XY and 7.4% of its Z, with no
interpolation at all. That is the recipe validated on
`ExPID96_2ndgel_S1_40XW001_18x` (affinity QC + merge-threshold sweep + published
layer), so the second 18x volume inherits it unchanged.

The other six take `target`: an area-average resample to [24, 18, 18] exactly.
Interpolating Z by 1.32-1.92 is the price; the alternative -- rounding to the
nearest integer factor -- would leave XY 18-26% off the training scale, and the
whole reason this workflow resamples at all is that the model is a conv net for
which voxel size is not a free parameter. Their actual output spacing is
`n*s/round(n/f)`, within ~0.1% of [24,18,18]; `prepare_volume.py` records it.

There is NO GROUND TRUTH for any moe volume, so nothing below is validated
against labels. See README.md.

    The model is a conv net trained at [24, 18, 18] nm ZYX, so voxel size is not
    a free parameter: neurite caliber measured in voxels is part of what it
    learned. Each axis is therefore driven to the training grid independently,
    and the choice is between three kinds of answer:

    * **block** -- an integer block average. Exact, no interpolation, but only
      lands on spacings `native * f`. Preferred whenever one of those is within
      `integer_tol` of the target.
    * **area** -- a fractional `cv2.INTER_AREA` resample that hits the target
      exactly, at the cost of interpolating.
    * **native** -- the axis is left alone because reaching the target would
      require *more* samples than the microscope took. Downsampling removes
      information that is there; upsampling manufactures information that never
      was, and closes no part of the sampling gap. This is the refusal recorded
      in `lessons/liconn_expansion_factor.md`; the deviation is reported rather
      than papered over, because the volume genuinely is off-grid on that axis
      and any result has to be read in that light.

    # ExPID107 is 14.5x: XY 11.034 nm resamples onto the 18 nm grid exactly, but
    # Z is 27.586 nm against a 24 nm target, so `auto` refuses to upsample and

    # the 600 nm/18x class (+38.9%).
    #
    # THESE ARE THE LARGEST PREPARED VOLUMES IN THE PROJECT, because XY only
    # shrinks 1.63x and Z not at all: 1.7-2.3 Gvoxel against ExPID108's 0.26.
